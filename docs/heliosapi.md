# helios - API Reference

## Introduction

Welcome to the API reference for the `helios` Framework.

`helios` is an ongoing, educational project and strives for providing a foundational and modular technical backbone for game development. Designed with a top-down, prototype-oriented approach, it emphasizes a clear separation of concerns and robust architectural patterns to help with creating maintainable games.

## Core Purpose

The primary objective of `helios` is to offer a flexible and extensible platform for interactive games. As a prototype, it provides the following systems:

- **Rendering Pipeline:** A rendering layer with customizable render passes.
- **Modular Subsystems:** Well-defined interfaces for core components such as Scene Management and Rendering.
- **Modern C++ Practices:** Leveraging C++(23) Modules for improved dependency management and compile-time efficiency.

## Architecture Overview
The framework's architecture follows a component-based philosophy, providing abstract interfaces that decouple high-level scene descriptions from underlying hardware implementations. Further details on specific modules, classes, and their relationships can be found within the respective namespace and class documentation sections.
