\begin{abstract}

We present \textit{helios}, a prototype game framework developed in C++ for creating a \textit{Geometry Wars} clone.
We outline the framework’s overall structure and describe the functionalities of its existing modules.
Furthermore, we justify key architectural and design decisions and discuss the challenges encountered during development.
Finally, we provide an outlook on the areas where major changes and refinements are expected in the subsequent stages of development.
