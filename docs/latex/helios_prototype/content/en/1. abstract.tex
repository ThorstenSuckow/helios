We present \textit{helios}, a prototype game framework developed in C++ for creating a \textit{Geometry Wars} clone.
    This report outlines the overall structure of the framework and discusses the functionalities of existing modules.
    Key architectural and design decisions are explained, along with the challenges encountered during development.
    Finally, we provide an outlook on the areas in which we expect the biggest changes in future iterations.
