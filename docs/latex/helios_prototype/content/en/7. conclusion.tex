\section{Conclusion and Outlook}

We have presented \textit{helios}, a prototype for a game framework for implementing a \textit{Geometry Wars} clone.

This was followed by an overview of the project data and the structure and architecture of the C++ project.
We discussed the toolchain and presented the third-party libraries used.\\

We reflected on difficulties encountered during implementation in a discussion.
These reflections raised interesting questions that are worth examining more closely:
How do different forms of the game loop~\cite[534 ff.]{Gre19} affect the \textit{game feel}?
What influence do the data structures taken from the standard library have on runtime when reallocated in the \textit{hot path} of the rendering?
And what performance advantage would we achieve by using \textit{raw pointers} as opposed to \textit{smart pointers}?\\

Due to the consistent application of generally accepted development principles, we currently see little need for structural changes.
However, it is advisable not to jump to conclusions here:
Before the technical domain is fully understood, a technical examination of the intrinsic properties of collision handling strategies and (artificial) enemy intelligence is still pending.
We expect several more development loops here.
In the same context, we are also cautiously optimistic about the design of the rendering pipeline.
Although its design follows clear semantic structures and is based on a conceptual idea (\textit{mental model}) of data processing, our research has shown that it is not only data-oriented systems that commonly form the foundation of efficient games (engines)~\cite{Bay22} - but also the optimal preparation and transfer of rendering instructions to the rendering backend.
This is where our design will have to prove itself in practice.\\

With all this in mind, it should not be forgotten that we have deliberately opted for a robust implementation at this early stage of the project.
We therefore look forward to the subsequent iterations.
With the project goal of ``16 ms per frame`` in mind, we conclude this document with a quote from Donald E. Knuth:
