# helios::engine::game::event

Collision and interaction events for the game event system.
This module provides system specific event types, like events dispatched by the collision detection system when GameObjects interact. Events follow an pub-sub pattern via the `EventBus`, enabling decoupled gameplay responses to collisions without tight coupling between systems.
