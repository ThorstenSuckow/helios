@namespace helios::engine::mechanics
@brief High-level gameplay systems and components for game logic.
@details This namespace contains the gameplay layer of the engine, providing components that store game state and systems that implement game rules. Components are pure data containers; systems read and modify them each frame. The namespace is subdivided into `bounds` for level boundary behavior, `combat` for weapon and projectile mechanics, and `spawn` for entity lifecycle management.
