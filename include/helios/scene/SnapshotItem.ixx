     * Structure for representing a snapshot item of a renderable's object
     * state at a specific point in time.
     *
     * The structure bundles a weak pointer to a Renderable and a pre-calculated
     * worldMatrix, serving as a lightweight DTO to be used with a `Snapshot`.
     *
     * A SnapshotItem captures the essential information to render an item
     * without the need to traverse the entire Scene Graph during the
     * rendering phase.
     * The worldMatrix is a copy of the SceneNode's worldMatrix at the time of this
     * creation, ensuring that its value remains constant, even if the transformation
     * of the SceneNode should change during rendering.
     *
     * Note that for the Renderable a weak pointer is stored to allow for checking its
     * existence in the render pass. While internal properties of the Renderable
     * might change while this SnapshotItem is processed, the worldMatrix is immutable
     * and reflects the transformation state at the moment the Snapshot was taken.
     *
     * Thus, as a precondition, we assume that no changes to the Renderable are
     * made while the Renderable "exists" as a weak ptr in a particular Snapshot
     * of a scene that would lead to invalidating its rendering. We rely on the
     * state information available within the Renderable as a reflection of its
     * state when the Snapshot was taken.
     *
     * @todo we're intentionally preferring stability over performance by using
     * weak_ptr instead of raw pointers. This leaves room for (performance) improvements
     * in later iterations.
     * The Renderable as a weak pointer can later on be further implemented into
     * a pure DTO, storing only scalar values that get send directly to the underlying
     * rendering backend (e.g. vaos, vbos etc.).
